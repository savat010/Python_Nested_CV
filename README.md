# Python_Nested_CV

In this repository, I created two jupyter notebooks for 1) regression prediction and 2) classification prediction to build machine learning models using nested cross validation.

## Regression Prediction Using Nested Cross Validation
The *Spending_Regression_Prediction* notebook consists of **eight regression models** such as a simple linear regression, ensembling models, a complex neural network, and more that I built to predict consumer Spending. I found the best model out of these eight predictive models using nested cross validation.

## Classification Prediction Using Nested Cross Validation
The *Spam_Classification_Prediction* notebook consists of **seven classification models** such as a simple logistic regression, ensembling models, SVM, and more that I built to predict whether or not an email is spam. I found the best model possible in terms of the overall predictive accuracy using nested cross validation. The notebook also consists of **four classification models** that I built to predict whether or not an email is spam while **accounting for the class imbalance** by adding a class weight hyper-parameter to the models. I found the best cost-sensitive model in terms of the average misclassification cost using nested cross validation.
